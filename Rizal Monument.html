                    <h1>Rizal Monument</h1>

                    <p>
                        The Rizal monument in Luneta, Philippines, is a famous sculptural landmark that is often visited by visiting dignitaries. It was approved by the United States Philippine Commission in 1901 and was built to commemorate Filipino patriot, writer, and poet Jos√© Rizal. The monument was designed by an international design competition between 1905 and 1907, with the first-prize winner being Carlos Nicoli of Carrara, Italy. The contract was awarded to Swiss sculptor Richard Kissling for his "Motto Stella" (Guiding Star). The shrine was unveiled on December 30, 1913, during Rizal's 17th death anniversary, and his poem "My Last Farewell" is inscribed on the memorial plaque. The site is guarded by ceremonial soldiers of the Philippine Marine Corps' Marine Security and Escort Group.

                    <h2>History</h2>

                    <p>
                        Rizal Park, located south of Manila's walls, was established in 1820 as the Paseo de Luneta. The area was once the site of a small town called Barrio Nuevo, which was strategically used by the British during their attack. The church of Bagumbayan was originally enshrined the Black Nazarene, but was transferred to San Nicolas de Tolentino inside Intramuros. The area later became known as Bagumbayan Field, where the Cuartel la Luneta, a Spanish Military Hospital, and a moat-surrounded outwork of the walled city of Manila were located. West of Bagumbayan Field was the Paseo de la Luneta, a long rectangular plaza named after the fortification. During the Spanish period, the park became notorious for public executions, with 158 political enemies executed.
