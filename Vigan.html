                    <h2>History</h2>

                    <p>
                        Vigan was a significant coastal trading post in pre-colonial times, where Chinese junks sailed from the South China Sea to Isla de Bigan. Sea-faring merchants bartered exotic goods from Asian kingdoms in exchange for gold, beeswax, and mountain products from the Cordilleras. Immigrants, mostly Chinese, settled in Vigan, intermarried with the natives, and started the multi-cultural bloodline of the Bigue√±os. In 1572, King Philip II sent Captain Juan de Salcedo with around 80 soldiers to explore the coast of Los Ilocano. After a successful expedition, Don Juan de Salcedo founded "Villa Fernandina de Vigan" in honor of King Philip II's son, Prince Ferdinand, who died at the tender age of four. Salcedo was awarded the old province of Ylocos as his Encomienda and was given the title as Justicia Mayor de esta Provincia de Ylocos. In January 1574, Salcedo returned to Vigan, bringing Augustinian Missionaries to pioneer the evangelization of Ylocos and establish a Spanish city to control neighboring countries. The place was named Bigan after a native mistakenly believed that Salcedo was asking for the name of a tuber plant from the "gabi" or taro family.
