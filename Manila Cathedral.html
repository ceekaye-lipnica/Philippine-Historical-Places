                    <h1>Manila Cathedral </h1>

                    <p>
                        The Minor Basilica and Metropolitan Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, also known as the Manila Cathedral, is a minor basilica in Intramuros, Manila, Philippines. It is the cathedral church of the Archdiocese of Manila, dedicated to the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary as the Patroness of the country. Originally a parish church under the Archdiocese of Mexico, it became a separate diocese in 1579. The cathedral has faced multiple damage and destruction, with the eighth and current structure completed in 1958. It has received papal endorsement from Pope Gregory XIII and three apostolic visits from Popes Paul VI, John Paul II, and Francis. Pope John Paul II raised the shrine to the status of Minor Basilica in 1981.

                    <p>
                        The Manila Cathedral, built in the Neo-Romanesque style, features a replica of the previous cathedral's northwest façade and statues of famous saints sculpted in Roman travertine stone. Italian artists created several artworks inside the basilica, including the statue of Rose of Lima, Jacob, Andrew, and Anthony the Abbot, and Francis Xavier and Polycarp. The tympanum above the central northwest doors bears the Latin inscription "To thy Immaculate Heart, entrust us and consecrate us."

                        The papal arms were added in 1981 to signify the cathedral's status as a basilica. Since Pope John Paul II's apostolic visit in 1981, a medallion bearing the papal arms has been placed beneath the cross of the façade and at the crossing above the high altar. The baptismal font and angel-shaped holy water fonts are made of solid bronze by Publio Morbiducci, while the prominent mosaic of Jude Thaddeus was made by Marcello Mazzoli. The 134 modern stained glass windows were made in 1964 by Filipino artist Galo Ocampo, who was commissioned and funded by Santos. The artistic designs of the stained glass windows were mostly products of Ocampo, a versatile contemporary Filipino artist. The marble floors on the center aisle near the altar bear the coat of arms of four cardinal archbishops of Manila: Rufino Santos, Jaime Sin, Gaudencio Rosales, and Luis Antonio Tagle.

                        The cathedra, or episcopal throne of the Archbishop of Manila, was installed during postwar reconstruction in 1958 and is made of Mexican onyx and marble from Carrara, Italy. The restored cathedra now bears a carving of Cardinal Jose Advincula's coat of arms, imposed on top of white Indian marble.

                    <p>
                        When Rajah Matanda came in Manila Bay in 1566, a secular priest named Fray Juan de Vivero officially founded the "church of Manila" in 1571. It was during this time that the cathedral was first dedicated. Alonso de Montúfar, the Archbishop of Mexico, despatched De Vivero, the chaplain on board the galleon of San Gerónimo, to establish Christianity as the spiritual and religious ruler of the recently acquired Philippines. Later on, De Vivero was appointed vicar-general and the city of Manila's first ecclesiastical judge.
