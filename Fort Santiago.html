                    <h1>Fort Santiago</h1>

                    <p>
                        Fort Santiago is one of the oldest fortifications in Manila built by the Spaniards in 1571 from what was once a palisaded structure of logs and earth built by Rajah Soliman on the native settlement called Maynila. The colonizers recognized that the tongue of land where the Pasig River flowed into the Manila Bay was a very strategic location.  The fort was destroyed in 1574 during the Chinese attack led by Limahong.  The stone fort was built between 1589 and 1592 and was repaired and extended after being damaged by the 1645 earthquake. Spanish, British, American and Japanese occupation forces used the fort as their headquarters and a prison for men, women, children and soldiers.  After its destruction during the Battle of Manila in 1945, the fort was used by the U.S. Transportation Corps as a depot until it was turned over to the Philippine government in 1946. In 1950, Fort Santiago was declared a Shrine of Freedom and restoration began the following year. Today, it stands as a memorial to the victims of World War II and the sacrifices of the Filipino people in pursuit of freedom.

                    <h2>Why is Fort Santiago called Fort Santiago</h2>

                    <p>
                        The fort, named after Saint James, the patron saint of Spain, was located at the mouth of the Pasig River and served as the premier defense fortress during the Spanish Government's rule. It became a main fort for the spice trade to the Americas and Europe for 333 years, starting from the Fuerte de Santiago. The fort has a perimeter of 2,030 feet (620 m) and is of a nearly triangular form. Its south front is a curtain with a terreplein, flanked by two demi-bastions - the Bastion of San Fernando and the Bastion of San Miguel. A moat connected with the river separates the fort from the city. Near the beginning of the north face, a cavalier called Santa Barbara was built with three faces of batteries, one looking seaward over the anchorage place, one facing the entrance, and the third looking upon the river. The 22-foot high walls, with a thickness of 8 feet (2.4 m), are pierced for necessary communications. The front gateway fa√ßade measures 40 feet (12 m) high and faces the city. Inside the fort were guard stations, barracks, quarters of the warden and his subalterns, storehouses, a chapel, the powder magazine, sentry towers, and cisterns.

                    <h2>History</h2>

                    <p>
                        Fort Santiago, located in the Philippines, was once the site of the old Maynila settlement, ruled by Rajah Sulayman. The palisade, made of bamboo and coconut log stakes, protected the polity and the river mouth from sea-pirates. In 1571, Spanish conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legazpi conquered Maynila and founded Ciudad de Manila. The palisades were later rebuilt in stone after the attack of Chinese pirate Lin Feng. Fort Santiago was named after Saint James, Slayer of the Moors (Santiago Matamoros), a Spanish icon and legendary depiction of the apostle St. James, the Great. This iconography was brought over to the Philippines and is displayed on the main gate of Fort Santiago. During occupation periods, Fort Santiago served as the military headquarters for the Spanish, British, Americans, and Japanese. The American flag was first raised in 1898, marking the transition of colonizing power. During World War II, the Japanese secret police, Kempei Tai, imprisoned and tortured hundreds of people. The main gate was destroyed, and the only remnants of the original structure are two carved stone sentries. After the war, Fort Santiago was restored as a public park and in 1951, it was declared a National Monument and a National Shrine, known as the "Shrine of Freedom," in honor of Dr. Rizal and the many people imprisoned, tortured, and martyred for the cause of freedom. In 2014, the National Museum of the Philippines declared it a National Cultural Treasure.
